            <h1>Fall Out Boy- The Phoenix:</h1><br>

            <p>Put on your war paint</p><br>
            <p>You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down</p><br>
            <p>Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground</p><br>
            <p>We are the jack-o-lanterns in July setting fire to the sky</p><br>
            <p>Here, here comes this rising tide, so come on</p><br>

            <p>Put on your war paint</p><br>

            <p>Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope-to-dies</p><br>
            <p>Silver clouds with grey linings</p><br>
            <p>So we can take the world back from a heart attack</p><br>
            <p>One maniac at a time we will take it back</p><br>
            <p>You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start</p><br>
            <p>So dance alone to the beat of your heart</p><br>
            
            <p>Hey young blood, doesn't it feel like our time is running out?</p><br>
            <p>I'm gonna change you like a remix</p><br>
            <p>Then I'll raise you like a phoenix</p><br>
            <p>Wearing our vintage misery</p><br>
            <p>No, I think it looked a little better on me</p><br>
            <p>I'm gonna change you like a remix</p><br>
            <p>Then I'll raise you like a phoenix</p><br>

            <p>Bring home the boys and scrap scrap metal the tanks</p><br>
            <p>Get hitched, make a career out of robbing banks</p><br>
            <p>Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks</p><br>
            <p>"You broke our spirit, " says the note we pass</p><br>
            
            <p>So we can take the world back from a heart attack</p><br>
            <p>One maniac at a time we will take it back</p><br>
            <p>You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start</p><br>
            <p>So dance alone to the beat of your heart</p><br>

            <p>Put on your war paint</p><br>

            <p>The war is won, before it's begun</p><br>
            <p>Release the doves, surrender love</p><br>
